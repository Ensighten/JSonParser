The program JSonObjParser.cc takes a JSON file as input and changes it into a JSON object. The program JSonObj.c provides methods to interact with the JSON object to get the specific values and vectors. 

We are using boost_1_44_0.

To use this JSON parser you will need to have the g++ and boost_1_44_0 installed on your system.

The source code is at /install/src.

The test code is at /install/example.


The ingredients are:
	
	JSonObjParser.h		(a header file that will be included in your program)
	JSonObjParser.cc	(actual parsing source code)
	JSonObj.h		(header file that will be included in your program)
	JSonObj.c		(three functions:
					T getValue<T>(keyName);
					std::vector<T> getVector<T>(keyName);			
					std::string getType(keyName);
				)



Sample command of compilation:

g++ yourFile.cc -I/(location of install dir)/install/include/ -L/(location of install dir)/install/lib/ -ljsoncpp
